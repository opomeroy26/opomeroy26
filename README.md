### Hi there 👋

My name is Olivia Pomeroy and I'm a Fullstack Software Engineer. With a background in Psychology and working with high-risk adolescents, I became passionate about programming after repetative frustrating experiences using electronic medical record software. It was then I started loving coding, as it allowed me to incorporate creativity and problem solving to create a better user experience!
